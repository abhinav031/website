I tried "creating" a static static and it worked. 

#Hosting
This website (as you may have guessed) is hosted on netlify.I can't afford other hosting providers and I don't really care aabout them as netlify works just fine. The repo for the website is hosted on github.

#Domain
I (again) can't afford a custom domain. I've tried to register a free domain but it kept failing. For now, I'll have to go with the netlify sub-domain. I've decided to use my github pages site to redirect to this site because I've used the domain in other places and dont want to change them.

#SSG
This website was made using [Hugo SSG](https://gohugo.io/) and the amazing [hello-friend theme](https://themes.gohugo.io/themes/hugo-theme-hello-friend/). I had a rather bloated HTML-CSS-JS site before on my gh-pages and felt like it needed an upgrade and hugo was the perfect choice.

#Content 
The content, for now, will be just some of my art but I'm planning to extend this site to potentially cover the other stuff that I do (more info in [the about section](content/about.md)).

#Final Thoughts
I think it is possibe for anyone who doesn't care about a custom domain to create their own website as long as one knows markdown. It was relatively easy and quick to create this site, all it took was some time and a github and netlify accounts. I'll probably do something about adding a custom domain but not anytime soon. so yeah... this is my website.
