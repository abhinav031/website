# Hi there

My name is Abhinav. I'm a digital artist from India.

Besides making "works of art" I also do other stuff including, a tiny bit of programming, using linux (I use arch btw), learning about space and spaceflight and solving Rubik's cubes and other such twisty puzzles as quickly as I can.

I'll post random stuff but mostly my creations to this website.
